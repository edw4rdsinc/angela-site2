    <h1>About Angela</h1>
    <h2>Becoming Who I’ve Always Been</h2>

    <section>
      <p>There was a moment — after a broken engagement and a quiet sabbatical — when I looked around and realized I didn’t need to rebuild who I was.</p>
      <p>I needed to <em>remember</em> her.</p>
      <p>For years, I’d been holding it all together — leading, supporting, doing the “right” things. But deep down, I felt stuck. Like I was living someone else’s version of my life. That season of undoing gave me something I never expected: space to finally become who I had always been.</p>
      <p>What followed was a slow, deeply spiritual journey of reconstruction — not the kind you can rush or script, but the kind that shifts your entire perspective. I started letting go of the lies I had believed about myself. I began to see with new eyes. I began to live with clarity, freedom, and joy.</p>
      <p>And now, I help other women do the same.</p>

      <h2>The Work I Was Made For</h2>
      <p>Coaching isn’t something I learned to do — it’s something I finally gave myself permission to do.</p>
      <p>It’s always been in me to walk with others through their stuck places, to sit in the rubble with them and whisper, <em>“You’re not broken. You’re becoming.”</em></p>
      <p>The Reconstructionists was born from that calling — a space where women can lay down the pressure to perform or prove, and instead start reclaiming the truth that’s always been there.</p>

      <h2>Who I Serve</h2>
      <p>I work with women who feel paralyzed — overwhelmed, disappointed, or grieving lost dreams. They find themselves asking, <em>“Is this it?”</em> but don’t yet know what “more” looks like.</p>
      <p>They’re not broken. They’re just standing at the edge of something new.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>What You Can Expect</h2>
      <p>This isn’t therapy. It’s not advice. It’s a process of rediscovery — guided by truth, at your own pace.</p>
      <p>As we work together, you’ll begin to loosen the grip of false beliefs and move into a truer, freer version of yourself.</p>
      <p>You’ll begin to see what I now know for certain:</p>
      <p><strong>You were never lost. You were just waiting for the space to return to yourself.</strong></p>
      <p>If something in this story feels familiar, maybe it’s time to begin your own reconstruction.</p>
